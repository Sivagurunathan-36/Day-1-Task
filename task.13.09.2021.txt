Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

These are the high-level differences between HTTP1 and HTTP2:

HTTP2 is binary, instead of textual
HTTP2 is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking
HTTP2 can, therefore, use one connection for parallelism
HTP2 uses header compression to reduce overhead
HTTP2 allows servers to “push” responses proactively into client caches  

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) 
in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
